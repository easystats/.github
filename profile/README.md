# *easystats*: An R Framework for Easy Statistical Modeling, Visualization, and Reporting

*easystats* is a collection of R packages, which aims to provide a unifying
and consistent framework to tame, discipline, and harness the scary R statistics
and their pesky models.

However, there is not (yet) an *unique* "easystats" way of doing data
analysis. Instead, start with one package and, when you'll face a new
challenge, do check if there is an *easystats* answer for it in other packages.
You will slowly uncover how using them together facilitates your life. And, who
knows, you might even end up using them all.
